This project follows the guide to codebook creation by Adrian Gadient-Br√ºgger at <https://www.adrianbruegger.com/post/simple-codebook/>

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('sjlabelled')
install.packages('psych')
library(tidyverse)
library(sjlabelled)
library(psych)
```

Load some example data:

```{r}
library(haven) # package to read files from popular statistical software packages such as SPSS, SAS, Stata
data <- read_sav("https://mmi.psycho.unibas.ch/r-toolbox/data/Cars.sav") # import data
```

The following commands work with labeled data, but the sjlabelled package has documentation [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sjlabelled/index.html) that includes examples of how to add labels.

```{r}
get_label(data) # show content of variables (what the variable measures)

# which returns for example:
# MPG               
# "Miles per Gallon"

get_labels(data) # show value labels (what the different answer options mean)
# note: the value labels are not used for this very simple codebook.

# which returns for example:
# $CYLINDER
# [1] "3 Cylinders" "4 Cylinders" "5 Cylinders" "6 Cylinders" "8 Cylinders"
```

Suppose that you want to extract the labels from a data set: the following code does so using the tibble library, included in tidyverse.

```{r}
# extract labels from dataframe and store as new object
simple_codebook <- enframe(get_label(data))

# use more informative column names
colnames(simple_codebook) <- c("variable_id", "item_text")

# Show the new data frame
simple_codebook
```

To include basic summary statistics of the data set along with the variables and labels, one can do this using the psych library:

```{r}
# get descriptive statistics and select those of interest
descriptives <- data %>% describe() %>% as_tibble() %>% select("n","min","max","mean")
# add stats to codebook 
simple_codebook <- cbind(simple_codebook,descriptives)
```

The following code will save the codebook in .csv format:

```{r}
# write to csv
write.csv(simple_codebook,file="simple_codebook.csv", na="", row.names=FALSE) 
```

```{r}

```

# Data Set Title

Generic food database groups and subgroups

## Description

Database of 900 common foods with 4 variables including the name, scientific name, group and subgroup.

## Details

This is a data set about 900 different foods, what their scientific name is, and what food groups and subgroups they would be placed under, collected nationwide to see which foods belong to which food family groups.

## Format

The variables are:

-   Food name - the type of food.

-   Scientific name -

-   Group -

-   Sub group
